        The point is... to live one's life in the full complexity of what one
        is, which is something much darker, more contradictory, more of a
        maelstrom of impulses and passions, of cruelty, ecstacy, and madness,
        than is apparent to the civilized being who glides on the surface and
        fits smoothly into the world.
